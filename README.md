# payroll

The following is a package of excel functions that will be useful for speeding up the calculation of payroll. As of now (11/25/2019) there is only the `=GET_PAY_BY_HOUR()` function- which calculates an employee's wages owed based on his times in, times out and hourly rate.

## Installing this package

Currently the functions need to be installed manually by creating modules in VBA and running the code for each function in a seperate module.

## Functions
